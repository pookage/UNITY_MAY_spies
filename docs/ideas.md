# Ideas

- You play as either the spies or security; **Spies** have to hack the central terminal to steal data without being captured, and **Security** need to identify and capture the spies.
- Entire scenario happens as part of a crowded mob, within which the spies can camoflauge themselves
- Security can stop and question anyone in the crowd, but stopping an innocent bystander will increase the anxiety of the crowd; if it gets too persecuted then the crowd may riot and become hostile to security.
- Spies need to complete a number of steps before they're able to hack the central terminal :

	1. Unlock the door providing access to the mainframe
	2. Start the hack
	3. Escape with the hacked data

There are multiple ways to achieve each goal:

## Unlock the door providing acccess to the mainframe

This door can be unlocked in multiple ways :

1. It can be blown open with explosives
2. A physical override key can be pickpocketed from the security guard
3. They can sneak behind a security guard unnoticed
4. They can hack a security guard so that when they open a door it reveals the security code for the spies to use

## Start the hack

1. If the spies have physical access to the terminal (have unlocked the door), they can brute-force it directly
2. Spies can also compromise a security guard, so that whenever they check on the status of the terminal the hack progresses slightly
3. They can slowly hack it remotely from any network port

## Escape with the hacked data

Once the data has been retrieved then the spies need to escape the scenario with it; but must also do it whilst blending in with the crowd
